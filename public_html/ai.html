        <ol>
          <li>LeBron has a better all-around skill set, with more size, speed, and strength than MJ.</li>
          <li>LeBron has a higher career player efficiency rating (PER) and win shares per 48 minutes (WS/48) than MJ.</li>
          <li>LeBron has made more All-Star appearances and All-NBA selections than MJ.</li>
          <li>LeBron has a higher career playoff scoring average than MJ, and has also been to more NBA Finals.</li>
