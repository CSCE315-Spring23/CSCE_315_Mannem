            <span> SOFTWARE ENGINEER</span>
            <p>I am a sophomore Computer Science honors student at Texas A&M University with interests in software engineering, machine learning, and building large-scale software systems. Specifically, I enjoy algorithm design and computer vision, but learning about new fields always enthrills me.</p>
            <p>I am originally from San Fransisco, but I moved to the Woodlands, TX at a young age and picked up an interest in the abilities of modern computers where I started building new innovations with Raspberry Pis. I work primarily in Java and C++ for algorithm and low-level coding, and Python for all machine learning and CV applications. </p>
            <p>I can speak English and Telugu at a native level and in my free time I can be found defending Lebron's legacy, playing tennis or basketball, and watching Lakers highlights. Some of my favorite computer science projects include ScolioScale, Belt for the Blind, and the Court Availability application that I created for my local township. Each of these projects allowed me to work alongside professionals in other fields to learn more about their industry in order to create a product better suited for their needs.</p>
            <p>Within computer science, my favorite division is machine learning due to its extremely innovative nature of learning a process rather than following a standard set of rules. Specifically, computer vision fascinates me because of its ability to closely replicate human vision and recognizing objects at an inherent level. As I delve into the mathematical theories of machine learning, I hope to develop new algorithms in this field to improve the potential accuracy of CV algorithms to better match real-world needs.</p>
            <p>Post-graduation, I hope to work as a SWE at a big tech company and later pivot to a machine learning role, so that I can experience both positions fully. Towards the end of my career, I hope to transfer to a managerial role in the PM area so that I can work with customers to develop product requirements.</p>
